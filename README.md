# tictactoe-nogui
Simple no-gui Python Tic-Tac-Toe program; made as a fun little project that helps me get into Python coding

# Short, but adorable presentation of the code
- We create an empty board
- Create the `play_game` function
  - Display the empty board into the terminal
  - Create a loop for checking if the game is over or not
  - Flip the player after the win / the tie
- Each player can select a position in which they want to place their symbol
- "Winners can be made by rows, columns or diagonals" - maybe someone in the forgotten history
- That's all
